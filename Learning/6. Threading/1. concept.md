# thread :
A thread is a separate flow of execution within a program, means in a program if there is multiple threads, they can run in parallel. Each thread runs independently, sharing the same memory space. Threads are lighter than processes, making them more efficient for tasks that require shared data.

# threading Module:
The threading module in Python provides a higher-level interface for working with threads. It is preferred over the older thread module, which is now deprecated. The threading module allows you to create, start, and manage threads in a straightforward manner.

## Process of Threading module:
- You can create and start a thread using the Thread class and its start method.
- The join method is used to wait for a thread to complete. This ensures that the main program waits for the thread to finish its execution before continuing.
- You can pass arguments to the target function of a thread using the args parameter.

### Example
``` python
import threading

def my_function():    # function to be used as thread
    print("Hello from a thread!")

# Create a thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=my_function) # target will tell which function to be threaded

# Start the thread
thread.start()      # srtarting thread

# Wait for the thread to complete
thread.join()       # waiting until the thread is finishing
```

### target parameter:
the target parameter is used to specify the function that the thread will execute when it starts. This function is called the "target function."
