# OOPS: 
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data or objects, rather than functions and logic. this helps to organize and capsulate data much specifically. key usage is in Games. it is made up with class, object & methods.

### Class :
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects which includes data & methods that defines the properties and methods that an object of that class will have. Properties are the data or state of an object, and methods are the actions or behaviors that an object can perform.

### Objects:
An object is an instance of a class, and it contains its own data and methods. For example, you could create a class called "Person" that has properties such as name and age, and methods such as speak() and walk(). Each instance of the Person class would be a unique object with its own name and age, but they would all have the same methods to speak and walk. and this all kept under the name of the object which makes better encapsulation & data binding.

## Key Features :

-- One of the key features of OOP in Python is encapsulation, which means that the internal state of an object is hidden and can only be accessed or modified through the object's methods. This helps to protect the object's data and prevent it from being modified in unexpected ways.

-- Another key feature of OOP in Python is inheritance, which allows new classes to be created that inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. This allows for code reuse and makes it easy to create new classes that have similar functionality to existing classes.

-- Polymorphism is also supported in Python, which means that objects of different classes can be treated as if they were objects of a common class. This allows for greater flexibility in code and makes it easier to write code that can work with multiple types of objects.
