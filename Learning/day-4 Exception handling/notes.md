# Exception Handling
Exception handling is the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events when a computer program runs. Exception handling deals with these events to avoid the program or system crashing, and without this process, exceptions would disrupt the normal operation of a program.

# <h2>Try & Except Block</h2>

tryâ€¦.. except blocks are used in python to handle errors and exceptions. The code in try block runs when there is no error. If the try block catches the error, then the except block is executed.


try block is used to verify a piece of code if it is ok or not. if the try block is satisfied then the except block is skipped but
if the try block is false then it will not show error but it will enter the except block and execute the code in it.
