User-defined functions:
We can create functions to perform specific tasks as per our needs. Such functions are called user-defined functions.


- Create a function using the def keyword, followed by a function name, followed by a paranthesis (()) and a colon(:).
- Any parameters and arguments should be placed within the parentheses.
- Rules to naming function are similar to that of naming variables.
- Any statements and other code within the function should be indented.
