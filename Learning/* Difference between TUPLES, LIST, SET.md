### Sets, lists, and tuples are all data structures in Python, but they have some fundamental differences:

#### Tuple: 
A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. In some ways, a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but a tuple is immutable, unlike lists that are mutable.

#### Dictionary: 
Dictionary in Python is an ordered (since Py 3.7) [unordered (Py 3.6 & prior)] collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Example: {1: “a”, 2: “b”, 3: “c”, 4: “d”, 5: “e”}. 

# key differences :: 

## Mutability:
- Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their elements after they have been created. You can add, remove, or modify elements in a list.
- Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed. You cannot add, remove, or modify elements in a tuple. Like an array we can not chnage the length of a tuple.
- Sets are mutable, but their elements are unique and immutable. However, you can add or remove items from a set.
- A dictionary is mutable, its Keys are not duplicated.
  
## Ordering:

- Lists, dictionary & Tuples maintain the order of elements, meaning the elements are stored in the same order as they were inserted.
- Sets do not maintain any order. The elements of a set are unordered, which means you cannot rely on the order in which elements are stored.
  
## Duplication:
 
- Lists and tuples can contain duplicate elements.
- Sets & dictionary do not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add a duplicate element to a set, it will be ignored.

## Syntax:

- Tuples are defined using parentheses (),
- Lists are defined using square brackets []
- Sets are defined using curly braces {}, but they can also be created using the set() constructor.
- The dictionary can be represented by { }.

```python
# List
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4]
# Tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 3, 4)
# Set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}

print("List:", my_list)  # Output: List: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4]
print("Tuple:", my_tuple)  # Output: Tuple: (1, 2, 3, 3, 4)
print("Set:", my_set)  # Output: Set: {1, 2, 3, 4}
