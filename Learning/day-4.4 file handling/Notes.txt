common modes in the file handling.

Before we can perform any operations on a file, we must first open it. Python provides the open() function to open a file. It takes two arguments: the name of the file and the mode in which the file should be opened. The mode can be 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, or 'a' for appending.

'r'	open for reading (default)
'w'	open for writing, truncating the file first
'x'	create a new file and open it for writing
'a'	open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
'b'	binary mode
't'	text mode (default)
'+'	open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)

The default mode is 'rt' (open for reading text).
