Python is under constant development and it didn’t have a match statement till python < 3.10. Python match statements were introduced in python 3.10 and it is providing a great user experience, good readability, and cleanliness in the code which was not the case with clumsy Python if elif else ladder statements. 

<h2>What is a ‘match-case’ statement?</h2>
For developers coming from languages like C/C++ or Java know that there was a conditional statement known as Switch Case. This Match-Case is the Switch Case of Python which was introduced in Python 3.10. Here we have to first pass a parameter then try to check with which case the parameter is getting satisfied. If we find a match we will do something and if there is no match at all we will do something else.

The match statement is initialized with the match keyword creating a block and taking a parameter ( here the name is also a parameter ) and then steps down to the various cases using the case keyword and the pattern, for the pattern to match the parameter. The ” _  ” is the wildcard character which is run when nothing is matched.
