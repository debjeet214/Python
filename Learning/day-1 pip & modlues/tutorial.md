Module is like a code library which can be used to borrow code written by somebody else in our python program. There are two types of modules in python:

- Built in Modules - These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly.
- External Modules - These modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by
  
<h3>The pip command</h3>
It can be used as a package manager pip to install a python module. Lets install a module called pandas using the following command

<h3>pip install pandas</h3>

<b>We use the import syntax to import a module in Python. Here is an example code:  import pandas</b>

# Read and work with a file named 'words.csv'
df = pandas.read_csv('words.csv')
print(df) # This will display first few rows from the words.csv file

Similarly we can install other modules and look into their documentations for usage instructions.
