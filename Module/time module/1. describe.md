# Time Module:
This is a module usaed to manipulate and work with the time in python. let's get through the different functions in time module.
The epoch is the point where the time starts, the return value of time.gmtime(0). It is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC) on all platforms.

# Functions:

## 1. Asctime():
The time.asctime() function in Python is used to convert a time represented by a tuple or a struct_time object into a string with a specific date-time format. This tuple should contain 9 elements that represent the following:

--> Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second, Day of the week, Day of the year & Daylight saving time flag.

```python
import time
t = (1993, 6, 9, 4, 26, 40, 2, 160, 0)
t1 = (2024, 9, 21, 18, 45, 38, 20, 160, 100)  # time tuples
print(time.asctime(t))                        # printing the time in particular format
print(time.asctime(t1))
```

## 2. ctime([sec])
This parameter represents the time in seconds since the epoch (Unix timestamp). 
- If secs is provided, time.ctime() will convert it to a string that represents the corresponding local time.
- If secs is not provided or is set to None, the function will use the current time as returned by time.time().
- o/p is in the date-time format only. ('Day Mon DD HH:MM:SS YYYY')
``` python
import time

# Get the current time as a string
current_time_str = time.ctime()             # this will return the current date and time only
print(current_time_str)
# o/p --> Sun Aug 11 18:09:55 2024

current_time_str2 = time.ctime(4150200000)
print(current_time_str2)                     # but this will return the exact date after the given amount of sec from 1970
# o/p --> Thu Jul  7 17:20:00 2101 
```
