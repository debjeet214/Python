# Time Module:
This is a module usaed to manipulate and work with the time in python. let's get through the different functions in time module.
The epoch is the point where the time starts, the return value of time.gmtime(0). It is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC) on all platforms.

# Functions:

## 1. Asctime():
The time.asctime() function in Python is used to convert a time represented by a tuple or a struct_time object into a string with a specific date-time format. This tuple should contain 9 elements that represent the following:

--> Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second, Day of the week, Day of the year & Daylight saving time flag.

```python
import time
t = (1993, 6, 9, 4, 26, 40, 2, 160, 0)
t1 = (2024, 9, 21, 18, 45, 38, 20, 160, 100)  # time tuples
print(time.asctime(t))                        # printing the time in particular format
print(time.asctime(t1))
```

## 2. ctime([sec])
This parameter represents the time in seconds since the epoch (Unix timestamp). 
- If secs is provided, time.ctime() will convert it to a string that represents the corresponding local time.
- If secs is not provided or is set to None, the function will use the current time as returned by time.time().
- o/p is in the date-time format only. ('Day Mon DD HH:MM:SS YYYY')
``` python
import time

# Get the current time as a string
current_time_str = time.ctime()             # this will return the current date and time only
print(current_time_str)
# o/p --> Sun Aug 11 18:09:55 2024

current_time_str2 = time.ctime(4150200000)
print(current_time_str2)                     # but this will return the exact date after the given amount of sec from 1970
# o/p --> Thu Jul  7 17:20:00 2101 
```

## 3. gmtime():
Converts a time expressed in seconds since the epoch (Unix timestamp) into a struct_time object representing UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). A struct_time object in UTC with the Daylight Saving Time (DST) flag (tm_isdst) set to 0. unlike asctime, it returns the tuple with description opposite to the asctime function.

```python
import time

# Convert current time to UTC
utc_time = time.gmtime()
print(utc_time)

# Convert a specific timestamp to UTC
utc_time = time.gmtime(1623079260)
print(utc_time)

# o/p time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=8, tm_mday=11, tm_hour=18, tm_min=28, tm_sec=43, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=224, tm_isdst=0)
# o/p time.struct_time(tm_year=2021, tm_mon=6, tm_mday=7, tm_hour=15, tm_min=21, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=158, tm_isdst=0)
```
## 4. localtime():
Similar to gmtime(), but converts the time into the local time zone. it only returns the current time according to the time zone only.

``` python
import time
print(time.localtime())  # --> this will return the current time only.
```
## 5. time.mktime(t)
Purpose: This function is the inverse of localtime(). It converts a struct_time object or a 9-tuple representing local time into a Unix timestamp (seconds since the epoch).

```python
import time

# Convert a struct_time object to a Unix timestamp
local_time = time.localtime(1623079260)
timestamp = time.mktime(local_time)
print(timestamp)

# Manually create a 9-tuple and convert it to a timestamp
t = (2021, 6, 7, 17, 41, 0, 0, 158, -1)  # Corresponds to 'Mon Jun  7 17:41:00 2021'
timestamp = time.mktime(t)
print(timestamp)
```
## 6. time.process_time() â†’ float
Return the value (in fractional seconds) of the sum of the system and user CPU time of the current process. It does not include time elapsed during sleep. It is process-wide by definition. The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the results of two calls is valid. The function returns the sum of the CPU time used by the system and user modes of the current process.

```python
import time

# Start time (CPU time before the code execution)
start_time = time.process_time()

# Example code to measure
for i in range(10000):
    i = i+1790  # Some operation
    print(i)

# End time (CPU time after the code execution)
end_time = time.process_time()

# Calculate the CPU time used
cpu_time_used = end_time - start_time
print(f"CPU time used: {cpu_time_used} seconds")
```
## 7. time.time()
the main purpose of it is to Get the Current Time: The time.time() function returns the current time as a floating-point number representing the number of seconds since the epoch (usually January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). Making the difference between the two time will tell about the time required for the process to work. 

```python
import time
current_time = time.time()
print(f"Current time (in seconds since the epoch): {current_time}")

start_time = time.time() # Measure elapsed time between two events

for _ in range(1000000): # Some operation
    pass

end_time = time.time()
elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time} seconds")
```

## 8. time.sleep():
This Pause Execution of the process. The time.sleep() function suspends (pauses) the execution of the current thread for a specified number of seconds. The argument to time.sleep() specifies how long the program should pause, in seconds. This can be a floating-point number to indicate a sleep period with sub-second precision.
```python
import time
current_time = time.time()
print(f"Current time (in seconds since the epoch): {current_time}")

start_time = time.time() # Measure elapsed time between two events

for _ in range(1000000): # Some operation
    pass
time.sleep(5) # pause the execution in 5 seconds.
end_time = time.time()
elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time} seconds")
```
