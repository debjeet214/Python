# Python
<h3>lets study, create, update and do project here</h3>

Actually, Python was invented in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the <b>Netherlands</b> as a successor to the ABC programming language. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's <b>"benevolent dictator for life"</b>. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.

** Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. it is a interpreted, high-level language. **

(In computer software, a general-purpose programming language (GPL) is a programming language for building software in a wide variety of application domains. Conversely, a domain-specific programming language (DSL) is used within a specific area. For example, Python is a GPL. )


<h2><u><b>Features of Python</b></u></h2>
1. Python is simple and easy to understand.

2. It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
   
3. Python is an open-source programming language.
   
4. Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
   
5. It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.

<h2><u><b>What is Python used for</b></u></h2>
1. Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.
2. Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
3. It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
4. It is used to create web applications.
5. It can be used to handle databases.
6. It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.

As of 17 March 2024, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 523,000 packages with a wide range of functionality, including: <b>Automation, Data analytics, Databases, Documentation, GUI, Image processing, Machine learning, Mobile apps, Multimedia, Computer networking, Scientific computing, System administration, Test frameworks, Text processing, Web frameworks, Web scraping</b>
