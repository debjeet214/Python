# Python
<h3> let's study, create, update and do a project here</h3>

Actually, Python was invented in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the <b>Netherlands</b> as a successor to the ABC programming language. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's <b>"benevolent dictator for life"</b>. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. it is an interpreted, high-level language. **

(In computer software, a general-purpose programming language (GPL) is a programming language for building software in a wide variety of application domains. Conversely, a domain-specific programming language (DSL) is used within a specific area. For example, Python is a GPL. )


## Features of Python

-   Python is simple and easy to understand.
-   It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
-   Python is an open-source programming language.
-   Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
-   It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.

## What is Python used for

-   Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.
-   Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
-   It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
-   It is used to create web applications.
-   It can be used to handle databases.
-   It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.

As of 17 March 2024, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 523,000 packages with a wide range of functionality, including: <b>Automation, Data analytics, Databases, Documentation, GUI, Image processing, Machine learning, Mobile apps, Multimedia, Computer networking, Scientific computing, System administration, Test frameworks, Text processing, Web frameworks, Web scraping</b>


## Applications of Python

<h4>The Python Package Index lists thousands of third-party modules for Python.</h4>
<h3>1. Web and Internet Development</h3>
Python offers many choices for web development:

- Frameworks such as Django and Pyramid.
- Micro-frameworks such as Flask and Bottle.
- Advanced content management systems such as Plone and Django CMS.

Python's standard library supports many Internet protocols:

- i. HTML and XML
- ii. JSON
- iii. E-mail processing.
- iv. Support for FTP, IMAP, and other Internet protocols.
- v. Easy-to-use socket interface.
- vi. the Package Index has yet more libraries:

Requests, a powerful HTTP client library.

- Beautiful Soup, an HTML parser that can handle all sorts of oddball HTML.
- Feedparser for parsing RSS/Atom feeds.
- Paramiko, implementing the SSH2 protocol.
- Twisted Python, a framework for asynchronous network programming.
- Scientific and Numeric

<h3>2. Scientific and Numeric computing:</h3>

- SciPy is a collection of packages for mathematics, science, and engineering.
- Pandas is a data analysis and modeling library.
- IPython is a powerful interactive shell that features easy editing and recording of a work session, and supports visualizations and parallel computing.
- The Software Carpentry Course teaches basic skills for scientific computing, running bootcamps and providing open-access teaching materials.

<h3>3. Education</h3>
Python is a superb language for teaching programming, both at the introductory level and in more advanced courses.

Books such as How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science, and Practical Programming.

<h3>4. Desktop GUIs</h3>
The Tk GUI library is included with most binary distributions of Python. Also, Some toolkits that are usable on several platforms are available separately:

1. wxWidgets
2. Kivy, for writing multitouch applications.
3. Qt via pyqt or pyside

Platform-specific toolkits are also available:
1. GTK+
2. Microsoft Foundation Classes through the win32 extensions

   
<h3>5. Software Development</h3>
Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for build control and management, testing, and in many other ways.

1. SCons for build control.
2. Buildbot and Apache Gump for automated continuous compilation and testing.
3. Roundup or Trac for bug tracking and project management.
   
<h3>6. Business Applications</h3>
Python is also used to build ERP and e-commerce systems:

- Odoo is an all-in-one management software that offers a range of business applications that form a complete suite of enterprise management applications.
- Tryton is a three-tier high-level general purpose application platform.
